DroidFrida is an android app for executing frida scripts directly on your android device. Frida is a dynamic instrumentation framework that allows to edit memory and hook methods, which is very useful when analyzing and cracking application (including games). Frida gives large posibilities, and I use it very often, so I created an app to use it easily.

### Progress

- [X] Basic frida script execution on the target app
- [ ] Improve UI, add optional floating activity for output
- [ ] Script repository browser


### Usage

You will need root access (or vphone) on your phone otherwise this won't work. Enter the package name of the target application as the -f flag and input your script  in the text field. You will be able to run target app with the frida injection.
